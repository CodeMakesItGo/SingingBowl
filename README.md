## What is the SiningBowl?
During the corona lock-down I've "slowly" realized that having time to yourself is very important. I think this is true if you are introverted or not. I am an introvert and being around family all day every day for weeks is, even though this sounds horrible, STRESSFUL!

I want to build a device that helps and promote meditation using singing bowl therapy. If you haven't heard a signing bowl, they produce an amazing sound that reverberates throughout your body. Just listening to signing bowl(s) for a couple seconds can calm you down a lot. Unfortunately, the same effect cannot be felt through listening to a recording. The vibrations the bowls create are just…different. I'm calling this device the Singing Bowl Player (SBP) because I'm super creative in thinking about names.

The player isn't physically complex, it is basically a one track record player that is spinning a heavy bowl instead of a flat record. My current plan is that it kind of looks like the Kitchen-aid blender.

This project was entered in the "Change the Planet with PSoC® IoT Design Contest". Check out the project here: https://hackaday.io/project/171713-singing-bowl-player
